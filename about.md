You have reached the homepage on the internet of Jonathan Beckett.

While not bashing my head against the desk repeatedly at work, or traveling around Europe pretending to be clever, I write idiotic blog posts, record podcasts, occasionally trudge around town in running shoes, and attempt to survive living in a house with four women, two cats, and a number of fish.

I live in deepest, darkest England â€“ land of good manners, punctuation, starched shirts, and silent indignation. I grew up near Oxford, and have ended up living in the countryside just outside London.

I like pizza (or anything easy to cook, really), wine, chocolate biscuits, tea, coffee, movies, music, and cycling. I am as as colour-blind as a hedgehog in a bag, but can draw a mean doodle. I listen to random music on Spotify, watch streaming TV shows on the internet, and wish I had more time and/or money to pursue a colossally nerdy interest in comic book artwork.
