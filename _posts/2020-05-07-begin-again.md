Welcome to my homepage on the internet. I'm not entirely sure if it makes sense for this site to exist, but it's here, and therefore it is (a rather terrible distortion of the latin phrase made famous by Ren√© Decartes).

I can't imagine it makes sense to write much here, when very few will find it, least read it - so I might direct you towards the [contact](/contact) page, that lists all manner of places I can be found and interacted with across the internet.
